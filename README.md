## How it works ?
Altitude is measured using a Presion BMP180 Sensor. Data is passed through a Kalman filter and then apogee is detected after 3 consecutive altitude drops.
Logs are stored in a SD card as CSV format, with 1kb redced EEPROM storage as backup (204 rows of 5 bytes).

Parachute deployment is done using a 180ยบ Servo motor
